# Search_agent
Imagine a n*n gird, there is an agent in one of the places of the first row. Each place contains a corresponding number to itself, describing the amount of points that place holds. The only valid moves for the agent are up, up-left and up-right. The goal is to reach one of the places at the most top row, while gaining the maximum points possible.
